# Advent of Code 2017

It is good to call this one as we're much past December 25, 2017. Here are solutions for 11 Days out of 25, which is actually my best attempt yet. I hope you enjoy some of the solutions I've wracked my brain against. While I may come back to 2017's advent of code, I won't be paying much more attention to this. 

Feel free to reference or add suggestions to any of my posted solutions. I'd love to learn more about C# or better solutions to the days posted. Toodles!
